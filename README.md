Design and implementation of a simple operating system called ZeOS for the subject Operative System 2 (Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona, UPC).  In this project, we have work with high-level (C) and low-level (assembly) programming languages. We have implemented:
- Input/output mechanisms (exceptions/interrupts/system calls).
- Proces management (data structures/algorithms/scheduling policies/ context switch/ related system calls)
- Input/output management (devices/ file descriptors)(
- Subroutines and exceptions
- Memory management.
