-->Running 8 Tests: Sbrk test <--
* Running Test [0] : [testsbrk1] SBRK(0)Check that sbrk(0) returns a value > 0 with the initial @
-- result OK
* Running Test [1] : [testsbrk2] SBRK(10)Check that the returned adresses match with the amount of bytes reserved
-- result OK
* Running Test [2] : [testsbrk3] SBRK(10)+useCheck that the returned adresses can be used
If something is wrong next instruction will generate a Page Fault-- result OK
* Running Test [3] : [testsbrk4] SBRK(10)+forkCheck that the fork gets a copy of this region
If something is wrong next instruction will generate a Page Fault-- result OK
* Running Test [4] : [testsbrk5] SBRK(10)+threadCheck that  a thread gets shared memory 
If something is wrong next instruction will generate a Page Fault-- result OK
* Running Test [5] : [testsbrk7] SBRK(max)Check maximum memory available
Allocated a maximum of 716800bytes
TEST: maximum heap can not be accomplished two times in a row-- result BAD
* Running Test [6] : [testsbrk8] SBRK(-max)Check that initial address is maintained 
TEST: releasing more data than reserved does not work as expected-- result BAD
* Running Test [7] : [testsbrk9] SBRK(1)+SBRK(4096)Check that boundaries are mantained 
If something is wrong next instruction will generate a Page Fault-- result OK
